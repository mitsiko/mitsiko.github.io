        <h2>KEY MILESTONES IN COMPUTING HISTORY</h2> 
        <p class="normalwidth">Computing has transformed from simple mechanical devices into powerful digital systems that shape every part of modern life. Let’s take a walk through some key moments that paved the way for the technology we rely on today.</p>


        <h3 class="red">1801: Jacquard Loom</h3>
        <p>The Jacquard loom, invented in 1804, used punched cards to control the weaving of complex patterns, automating the process and reducing the need for manual labor. Its use of punched cards influenced early computing, notably inspiring Charles Babbage’s Analytical Engine and later computer programming methods.</p>

        <h3 class="lgreen">1936: Alan Turing and the Turing Machine</h3>
        <p>A Turing machine is a theoretical computing device invented by Alan Turing, which consists of an infinite tape and a read/write head that can move left or right to perform computations based on a set of rules. It serves as a fundamental model for understanding the limits of what can be computed and forms the basis for modern computer science concepts.</p>

        <h3 class="lpurple">1943: The ENIAC</h3>
        <p>The ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer) was one of the earliest general-purpose electronic digital computers, developed in the 1940s at the University of Pennsylvania. It was designed to perform complex calculations for the U.S. Army and used vacuum tubes to execute arithmetic operations at unprecedented speeds for its time.</p>

        <h3 class="custard">1976: The Apple I</h3>
        <p>The Apple I was the first computer designed and built by Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs in 1976, featuring a single-board design with a CPU, RAM, and basic video circuitry. It was sold as a kit that required assembly and was notable for its role in the early development of the personal computer industry.</p>

        <h3 class="lblue">1991: The World Wide Web</h3>
        <p>Invented by Tim Berners-Lee, the World Wide Web (WWW) is a vast, interconnected network of online resources that allows users to access and share information through websites and web applications using a web browser. It operates over the internet by utilizing protocols like HTTP and HTTPS to enable the retrieval and display of text, images, and multimedia content from servers worldwide.</p>

        <h3 class="purple">2007: The Smartphone Revolution</h3>
        <p>The introduction of the iPhone by Apple marked the beginning of the smartphone revolution, fundamentally transforming the mobile phone industry with its touch interface, internet connectivity, and integrated apps. This innovation set new standards for smartphones and paved the way for a surge in mobile technology advancements and app ecosystems.</p>

        <h2>INTRODUCTION TO IT BASICS</h2>
        <p class="normalwidth">Now that we’ve explored computing’s evolution, let’s dive into the core concepts of Information Technology (IT), the backbone of modern businesses and organizations.
        </p>

        <h3 class="red">1. Hardware</h3>
        <p>Hardware refers to the physical parts of a computer, such as:</p>

        <p class="indent"><bold class="red">CPU (Central Processing Unit):</bold> The brain of the computer, which processes data.</p>
        <p class="indent"><bold class="red">Memory (RAM):</bold> Temporary storage that helps the CPU quickly access data.</p>
        <p class="indent"><bold class="red">Storage (HDD/SSD):</bold> Where your data is permanently stored.</p>

        <h3 class="custard">2. Software</h3>
        <p>Software is the set of instructions that tell the hardware what to do. It’s divided into two categories:</p>
        
        <p class="indent"><bold class="custard">System Software:</bold> This includes operating systems like Windows, macOS, or Linux, which manage hardware and software resources.</p>
        <p class="indent"><bold class="custard">Application Software:</bold> Programs like word processors, games, and web browsers designed for end users.</p>

        <h3 class="lgreen">3. Networking</h3>
        <p>Networking allows computers to communicate with each other. Whether it’s sharing files at home or managing a global organization’s operations, networking is key to connecting devices:</p>
    
        <p class="indent"><bold class="lgreen">LAN (Local Area Network):</bold> Used for small areas like homes or offices.</p>
        <p class="indent"><bold class="lgreen">WAN (Wide Area Network):</bold> Covers large areas, such as the internet itself.</p>
    

        <h3 class="purple">4. IT in Modern Organizations</h3>
        <p>Today, IT plays a crucial role in how businesses operate. From cloud computing to cybersecurity, organizations rely on IT for:</p>
    
        <p class="indent"><bold class="purple">Data Management:</bold> Storing, retrieving, and analyzing data.</p>
        <p class="indent"><bold class="purple">Security:</bold> Protecting sensitive information from cyber threats.</p>
        <p class="indent"><bold class="purple">Automation:</bold> Streamlining processes to improve efficiency.</p>
    
        <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
        <p class="normalwidth">Computing has come a long way, from simple mechanical devices to the complex systems powering today’s world. Understanding IT fundamentals helps us appreciate not only how far we’ve come but also how deeply technology influences our lives and businesses. Stay tuned as computing continues to evolve, transforming every corner of society.</p>
